Package UniqueID_Go is the home of a data type we call "UniqueID".

### Unique ID â†’ UniqueID
As the name implies, a Unique ID instance is a unique (lowercase-only) alphanumeric ID.

These IDs can be used to identify database records, customer accounts, and so on.
These IDs are meant for simple use-cases only. Look elsewhere if you need something that is also crypto-safe.
